## Setup
download/clone repo

Login to Upwork, navigate to the job search page within the category of your choice. In my case it was "Web, Mobile, & Software Development". Make sure the results are sorted by "newest". Then click on the icon that looks like a green wifi logo. Right click on RSS, then copy the URL.

If you want email sending capabilities, first create a new Gmail account. Then go into the account settings and enable "less secure apps". 

After creating your email account for sending emails, open upwork-rss-parser.py and edit the following values:

KEYWORDS = ["website", "wordpress", "react", "javascript", "landing", "elementor"] #keywords to look for in title/description

MINIMUM_BUDGET = 250 #Minimum budget to search for in dollars

RSS_URL = "https://www.upwork.com" #Upwork RSS URL that you gathered earlier

TO_EMAIL = "email@email.com" #Email address that you want to receive the notifications on 

FROM_EMAIL = "email@gmail.com" #Email address that you created on Gmail with less secure apps enabled

SLEEP_TIME = 250 #Time to sleep between Upwork RSS HTTP GET requests


run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` in project root directory

run `python3 upwork-rss-parser.py` in project root directory
